About
======

This mod is A combination and remix of Uncharted Lands and New Horizons, Both of which were created by KillAshley and are currently being maintianed by GregroxMun. The NH side is also from my fork of GregroxMun's fork.

This mod, in short (at least for now) is Just NH with UL's bodies relpacing the bodies from stock KSP. along with much renaming of most of the bodies from NH's IC patch amongst other things.

Installation Instructions
==========================
This is mostly copied from NH's Readme.
First, Ensure any old versions of UH and Koprenicus are removed.

You Must delete these files

You will have to to download it's dependency, Kopenicus/KopernicusContinued depending on the version. This is required to run the mod.
Just download the latest release, & and hotfixes available.
 
Simply copy the files in the GameData file in the downloaded .zip files into your KSP install's GameData file.

This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.
